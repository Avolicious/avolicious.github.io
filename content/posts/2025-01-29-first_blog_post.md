Hey folks, I would like to start an experiment. This blog aka my new project is about improving my technical writing skills and should be used as a time capsule.
During my time as software developer, system administrator and whatsoever I've been confronted with difficulty and different problems, so this blog should keep
track of what I did and more preferably why.

## What will this blog be mainly about?
The goal is to showcase some interesting problems I've faced and write down how I solved this problem.
