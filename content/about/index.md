# About me

Hi, I’m Avolicious, a proud Chief Everything Officer (CEO) — which is just a fancy way of saying _I do everything because no one else wants to_.

For over a decade, I’ve been keeping a global gaming network running, which basically means:

- **Finance**: Making sure we don’t go bankrupt (yet).
- **Sys Administration**: Trusting people in [ServerFault](https://serverfault.com/) answers.
- **Development**: Writing code, think about what I've done, rewrite it.
- **Maintenance**: Typical friday deployer.
- **Networking**: I like TCP, but sometimes UDP is important - same goes for reality.
- **Crisis Management**: Waking up at 3 AM to fix things I definitely didn’t break.

Basically, if there’s a button that shouldn’t be pressed, a database that shouldn’t be dropped or an update that definitely shouldn’t be deployed on a Friday — I’m probably involved.

Outside of this chaos, I’m a casual gamer, part-time problem solver and full-time enthusiast for making things work (even if I have no idea why they do).

Welcome to my corner of the internet—where everything mostly works.
